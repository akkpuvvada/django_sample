# Testing in Django

## Steps of TDD

1. Red (Write test)
2. Green (Write production code to pass the test)
3. Refactor

## Uncle Bob's 3 Laws of Test Driven Development

1. You may not write any production code until you have written a failing unit test.
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.

## Naming Convention

> It is recommended to name classes as SomethingTest and test case function as test_something.
